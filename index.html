So I constructed you this website, a letter inside a webpage, for you. I swear, when I have money, I will give you a present.I'm just having money difficulties. </p>
		<p id="paragraph2">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Rems, I wish you a happy 18th birthday! I wish you the very best. I wish you the best of luck in the future. I understand that we will struggle during our college years, but I will assist you in every way I can. I am delighted to be a part of your fantastic party. I'm grateful that I'll get to swim in a pool with my friends.</p>
		<p id="paragraph3">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I hope you enjoy my cheap letter. I believe the words I chose will surprise you; I just used the quillbot heheh. Just wanna showcase my skills on programming hehehe.</p>
		<p id="paragraph4">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp We love you Remy. We will always be here. Happy Birthday!!!</p>
